This application uses a device's location services to pull a 5-day forcast for the determined location.

N.B.
This app requires location services permission to access local forecast data. Please allow this access when prompted on first launch.

Icons used in this app are those made available from http://openweathermap.org Because they are only available in one size, these images may appear pixelated on retina devices
